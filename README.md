## Description

🏆

- Motivational skills refer to the actions I take to elicit a desired outcome, response or behavior. These skills encourage me or others to achieve our workplace goals.
- Creating is about getting around the obstacles that are presented to me.
  “You can dream, create, design, and build the most wonderful place in the World Wide Web . But it requires people to make the dream a reality.”
- In general, the Code Quiz's job is to convert problem solutions into instructions for you to answer and learn.🏆
